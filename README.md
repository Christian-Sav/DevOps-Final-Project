# DevOps-Final-Project
Repository containing all relevant files for Devops Final Project

## Brief
We were required to plan, design and implement a solution for automting the  development workflows and deployments of the following application. We had to consider what tools worked best for us; Terraform , Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker, Github, Jenkins and Jira. We had to consider how a developer can test new features on an enviroment before merging their changes to the main branch and how changes on a GitHub repository could automatically build and deploy to testing and LIVE enviroments. As well as the technical considerations we also had to consider the running costs and our monthly estimates.
